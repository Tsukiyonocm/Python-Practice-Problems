# Python-Practice-Problems

Reason for File: 
The purpose is largly to just store information about Python as I am learning it as well as to store the practice problems I do
and showcase the ones I complete. I will likely create a index of the questions as well in the future in order to practice things 
again. Right now the questions are all from Jose Portillas Python Bootcamp, but, I will do Codewars problems as I get better
with the syntax and will probably start putting some of those here as well. Quite possibly even Edabit as I found those questions to 
be a bit easier back when learning JavaScript.

Things to do for README: 
1. Figure out how to style this again. I always forget the correct coding needed for styling markdown files.
